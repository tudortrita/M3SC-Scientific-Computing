Sing, Michael, sing
On the route of the nineteen bus
Hear them sayin'
How you get a rude and a reckless?
Don't you be so crude and feckless
You been drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail
We reply
I know that my life make you nervous
But I tell you that I can't live in service
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose
Rudie can't fail
I went to the market to realize my soul
What I need I just don't have
First they curse, then they press me till I hurt
We say Rudie can't fail
First you must cure your temper
Then you find a job in a paper
You need someone for a savior
Oh, Rudie can't fail
We reply
Now we get a rude and a reckless
We been seen lookin' cool an' speckless
We been drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail
I went to the market to realize my soul
'Cause what I need I just don't have
First they curse, then they press me till I hurt
Rudie can't fail
Okay! Okay!
So where you want to go today?
Hey boss man!
You're looking pretty smart
With your chicken skin suit
You think you're pretty hot
In the pork pie hat
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
Rudie can't fail
